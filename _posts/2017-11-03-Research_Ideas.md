Our research group began looking into language and the area of computer mediated communication (CMC studies).
We listed a few different branches of this area we found interesting:
* how emotions a communicated through computing (emoji, eml, haptics)
* how  computers understand and process emotion 
* how a programmer expresses emotion, and creative thinking, into their software
* how software and hardware give constraints to a programmer that both limit their expression and give them a structure to communicate through


Some of the key words: Computer Mediated Communication, Social Presence Theory, Social information processing theory, Emotional display behavior 


We looked at how emoticons such as ;) :D :p evolved into emojis and considered what limits these had on communication, and considered the arguments in "The role of emotion in computer-mediated
communication: A review" by Daantje Derks, Agneta H. Fischer, and Arjan E.R. Bos 2007, which explored the arguments that emotion is more difficult to exress in CMC than in face to face (F2F) communication. The conclusion of this research was that 
>"communication online and offline is surprisingly similar, and if the difference are found they show more frequent and explicit emotion communication in CMC than in F2F"
>no evidence to assume that emotions are absent or event difficult to communicate in CMC" but also "no research - to our knowledge - that has examined this issue of emotional control" in relation to spontaneity and visibility of a partner in a conversation.

They explained that CMC reduced spontaneity as it offered a delay in communication which allowed for a different state of emotional control. Their research showed that CMC "does not lead to emotionally poor interactions" just a different form of expressing emotion. We considered the relationship between expression emotion through computers to others and putting emotion into computers. How can artists use software and hardware to have a better control over the restrictions of these mediums? If computers create a different but not lesser form of expression should we use this different form, or attempt to change how we are constrained to bring CMC inline with F2F?

For our first research presentation we presented three slides. The first was of the [Shakespeare Programming Language](http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/). An [esoteric language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page) where the programmer writes code that looks like a Shakespeare play, the variables use the names of characters, functions are called acts, and a natural, shakespeare-like, language is used for conditional expressions. We talked about how these esoteric languages offere programmers a space to explore how the language you use effects how you think about, and solve, problems and how programming langugaes effect how you understand systems, how you see the world. We posed the question of how this effects artists using computing in their work.

The second slide was of the proposal to W3 Consortium of an addition called [Emotional Markup Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/emotionml/) which uses a list of emotional states (in english) and values ranging from 0 to 1 which are then combined in tags to express different emotions. We spoke about the aims of this language, and the failures of it. How culture effects emotion, and how words and values are ultimatly unable to grasp emotion. We were concerned with the danger of cultural and language bias that would exist in this proposal, and the acknowledgement of this in the proposal.

</emotion>

The last slide was of [Alvin Luciers Music for Solo Performer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIPU2ynqy2Y) from 1965, in which the composer wears a headset which takes brainwaves and uses the signals as controls for various percussion instruments. Our group considered how this could be seen as similar to EML, yet somehow escaping the issues of language. We talked about how the logic had instead been switched to a signal, so sounds do not represent emotion but instead a state of activity.
