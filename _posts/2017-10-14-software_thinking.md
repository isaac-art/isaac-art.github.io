Software holds inside it ways of thinking. These ways of thinking of individuals or groups are noted down and structured into algorithms, these becomes parts of software, which interact with the world around them, shifting meaning and purpose, but continually pulling the way of thinking through systems and mechanisms that influence the behaviour of people.

###### - Software Studies / A lexicon. ed Matthew Fuller.

As a piece of paper is connected to the material that makes it, connected to the sun that grew it, everything comes together. Software is no different, it is connected to the people and the cultures that created it, the hardware it runs on, the input data and the results it gives. Writing software is a social act. Writing software is a political act. I'd like to make software that explores different ways of seeing and thinking about the world. Everything we know about the world is that it isn't binary, things drift and are fuzzy and there are many shades of being - so how does a box of switches help? 

We share our thoughts and our time with computers, yet so often people are asked to think in the logical way, to adjust how they see the world to the way that works in the computer. How is this affecting memory and experience? If I share my photographs with a photo storage app it will present them back to me in a way that a group of programmers and designers in Silicon Valley thought best. The stories will be reordered, mapped, and analyzed. If every film maker is using final cut pro and adobe to edit their films will they be able to escape through it to their own way of thinking, or are they trapped into the limits of someone elses logic?

It's not that limits can't be useful though. Playing games is an example of how rules can lead people to unexpected places.

>“Games, whether digital or analog, function precisely the same way computers do: they are derived from a system of rules that sets forth parameters or constraints for dynamic interactions.” - Games AS Art: The Aesthetics of play. Celia Pearce.

The rules are in place, and the players explore the possibilities right up to the edges. Maybe it is in making these edges we actually help people walk right up to them? By creating software that represents how I think, I allow people to push up against my boundaries towards their own. This has to be embraced by the user though, and our behaviour seems to make us adjust to discomfort and limitations rather than work around them. We talked before about the 'calculative ambience' of a space. The information and the systems in an environment that are not present in our minds constantly adjust our behaviour, how we walk down a street, where we sit, who we talk to. Fate determined by what is rational/logical to a group of people. How do we find the cracks to slip through? There are no words for love. I'd like to make software that soaks in being, a liminoid undirected play rather than rules to another game. Software that encourages people to stop using it. Software that breaks other software.
