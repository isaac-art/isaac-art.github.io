Software holds inside it ways of thinking. These ways of thinking of individuals or groups are noted down and structured into algorithms, these becomes parts of software, which interact with the world around them, shifting meaning and purpose, but continually pulling the way of thinking through systems and mechanisms that influence the behaviour of people.

###### - Software Studies / A lexicon. ed Matthew Fuller.

As a piece of paper is connected to the material that makes it, connected to the sun that grew it, everything comes together. Software is no different, it is connected to the people and the cultures that created it, the hardware it runs on, the input data and the results it gives. Writing software is a social act. Writing software is a political act. How do we develop in a way that understands this? I'd like to make software that explores ways of seeing and thinking about the world. Everything we know about the world is that it isn't binary, things drift and are fuzzy and there are many shades of being - so how does a box of switches help? 
In embracing and manipulating software can we create any new collisions?
