The first swarm I encountered arrived in the post. A warm humming box was in the back of the post van which the delivery driver refused to pick up. We took it down the garden and opened it over the hive and a ball off bees dropped out.


The second time was about a year later. We had received a phone call about a swarm on the end of a terraced house. We put on our overalls and got a box to catch them in. The bees will all clump around the queen when out in the open, so we got a stick and nudged them so the dropped down off the wall. 


The most memorable time was a few years later, the other hives had all be lost to various illnesses and bad weather. It was spring time and me and my dad were talking in the kitchen when we both suddenly tuned into a humming sound out side. We opened the back door and saw a huge swarm, a completely different dynamic from the groups I had met before, these bees were looking for somewhere to go. We took some sugar syrup and left it on top of an empty hive and within a few minutes the loud noisy sky had settled as the all moved into their new home.

The incoherent voice does have something it is trying to speak, and in the bee’s case is something very important, and that ignoring it may be efficient short term but a place should still exist for that voice to be heard, as it may well end up being something that saves everything.

There are similarities to how a rebellious/dissenting voice is essential to democracy, questions and disorder are neccessary.

It is as though the bee has achieved englightenment. It has returned to the other bees with this great knowledge and now spends its time searching for the way to communicate this knowledge. The bee has become something new, it has been through this self discovery.
