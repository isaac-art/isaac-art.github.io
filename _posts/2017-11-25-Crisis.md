In this short text I will talk about Wendy Hui Kyon Chun's essay Crisis, Crisis, Crisis; or, The Temporality of Networks [2] in relation to the creation and collapse of The DAO on the Ethereum Blockchain. With reference to competitions like underhanded C and underhanded solidity I will address the idea of 'Trustless smart contracts' and if they are in fact increasing the amount of trust required.

Ethereum is a general purpose blockchain, a distributed ledger of transactions designed to handle a variety of exchanges and agreements, smart contracts programmed and placed onto the blockchain, and excecuted automatically by the network when they are called and their conditions are met. 

An example of how this can be used is a bot I coded for a hackathon in June 2017 that runs inside of the [Toshi](https://www.toshi.org/) App, an Ethereum dapp browser. My bot incentivises people to learn chinese by earning rewards through practicing. Once the bot is live it can live on without me - forever checking if people are practicing chinese. My bot won the prize of

A more advanced example of an ethereum organisation would be The DAO, an attempt to create a decentralised autonomous organisation. DAOs emerged out of an idea that in the future there may no longer be companies but instead just networks. Ethereum and The DAO are often referred to as being 'Trustless', you dont need to trust that another person will fulfill their side of a contract. The smart contract as a non-human actor makes the decisions and removes the responsibility from the humans either side onto itself, it "transparently pronounces itself".  You can engage with the contract knowing that it offers certain possible futures. 

>"A decision that would not go through the test and ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision; it would only be the programmable application or the continuous unfolding of a calculable process"[3]

>"any responsibility worhy of its name depends on a decision that must be made precisely when we know not what to do"

'Crisis' 

"...crisis both exceeds and is structurally necessary to networks. In part because both hardware and software operate according to a nonhuman, machinic temporality, network technologies must be repeatedly cared for in response to (and to prevent) crises that would disrupt connectivity."[1]

the dao hack

back to 'trustless'

"We are increasingly called on both to trust coded systems and to prepare for events that elude them."
If you can't read the contract code how can it be trusted? And even if you can read it how can you trust it can handle all the events that may occur. What if you read the contract does one thing but in fact does something else?

Earlier this year the [Underhanded Solidity](http://u.solidity.cc/) competition was announced to encourage Solidity (an Ethereum contract language) developers to write contracts that would hide their true intentions. The aim of this contest is to find the [tricks](https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017) possible in the language so that people will be more aware of possible hacks. 




community decisions

Split chain
- a timeline where the hack happened
- a timeline where the hack didnt happen
- 

Why maintain the 'code is law timeline', why I favour the human decisions timeline. Human agency "surrendered"

"Exceptional crises justify states of exception that undo the traditional democratic separation of executive and legislative brances"

-Exceptions
-Excecutive
-Excecutor



Caring for the network, caring for the non-human, caring for the world. 

'The value isnt data, its community and social consensus'


Perhaps this is now our role, the benevolent overseers, making sure our robots don't crash, telling our paperclip ai it doesn't need to overthink it[4]
