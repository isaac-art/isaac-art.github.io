## Writing Excercises



Sitting alone I don’t know where they are, I don’t feel anything from them. I can here the chime of the lifts, and the doors opening. I hear creaks around the room. I feel my chair and the floor.

When I look at the screen I see you sitting in blue, in front of a white wall. To the side of you is a green button, and a white phone. There is a line running up the wall. I see myself in the corner of the screen. I am looking at the space around you. Around the screen is a desk, and a pen, and a water bottle. You are inside it all, in the stream in the screen.

Closing my eyes I became very aware of my posture, resting my elbows on myself holding my hands out like tables which their hands were placed upon. 
Small movements were picked up, movements you wouldn’t notice in another person if they were not touching you, little twitches of finger muscles, which would cause you to reciprocate, like the muscle is one.
But there is a space between which becomes more physical. Even now that their hands are gone I can feel traces, but not just empty spaces- physical traces. Our hands got warm and clammy and I can still feel that moisture on me. 
When I was young me and my sisters used to play a game where we would sit and hold our fingertips as close together as we can and try and make the gap between the fingers as small as possible, it would feel like little electric shots shooting between our fingertips when they would tap and we would recoil. Now I am older and the tensions have changed. 
I wonder what they are writing. The same actions leading to different thoughts. Feedback into one another. It make me think of that Nan Shephard line about ‘knowing another is endless.. the thing to be know grows with the knowing’. I don’t really know these people, but I know them a little more than I did, and that step together creates new paths of knowing.

I can imagine driving. 
There is a place I am going to, and a way there.
There is a sequence of events that could get me where I want to be.
But instead I am finding a new way there.

Maybe there is a voice from the dashboard telling me to continue straight. 
Maybe there is a village on the left or a river to the right. 

There is some kind of resistance in the air. Like an invisible static wall in a tape factory.
And my availability draws me in, or maybe it pushes me back.
There is a stillness and silence over there. And maybe I’ll see more in the place I am travelling to if I look at what is nearby. 

Maybe I am driving along a road that follows the border of a country, or the contour of a county.
Or I’ve followed a dirt track across a dry field, or maybe it went into the woods and the trees are blocking the light and its dark in the shadows, and I can see little creatures moving on the ground. 

Maybe the weather looks better, maybe it looks worse, either way it is different to here. 
Maybe there is dust kicked up by the tires. Maybe the sounds echo around in a tunnel.
