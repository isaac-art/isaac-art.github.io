Following on from the first weeks research we continued by limiting our discussion to how a programmer is effected by the language/software/hardware they are working in, what the constraints are and how they are useful, and how do we escape them. 

We talked about the novel A Void by Perec in which the writer never uses the letter 'e', and how a translation was written into english which also didn't use the letter 'e'. This led onto further ideas of unlearning, and how we break what we know.

The term for the field we are investigating is [Linguistic Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity). Which states that syntax and structure in language effects the understanding of the person using that language. This is a field which had been studied in relation to spoken and written language, but there is not much research relating the computing languages and hardware. It is noted that Kenneth Iverson, the creator of the language APL has discussed this in his Turing ward lecture ['Notation as a tool of thought'](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf), and is also an interest of Yukihiro 'Matz' Matsumoto the creator of the Ruby programming language who mentions Babel-17, a novel by Samuel R Delany based on the idea of linguistic relativity as an influence. It is also reffered to in the 2016 film Arrival.

We found the University of Chicago has recently funded a large [research project](https://www.ci.uchicago.edu/press-releases/mind-tools-how-computer-programming-languages-impact-science-and-thought) into this area.
>“The idea is to examine the way in which computer languages can both expand and limit how individual and collective minds work,” said James Evans, director of the Knowledge Lab, professor of sociology at UChicago and Computation Institute senior fellow. “We’re trying to figure out how human minds respond to different functions and different domains, both in programming languages and in popular data science environments.”


We have decided to experiment with [IBMs Watson API](https://personality-insights-livedemo.mybluemix.net/) to see how the words used in common programming languages could be understood through tone analyzers and personality insight tools normally used to examine opinion and interested of individuals. We will also explore how words meanings and popularity has changed using tools like [nGram](https://books.google.com/ngrams) to see how programming langugages and ways of seeing and thinking are infiltrating everyday language, are we thinking more programatically as a society.

I have also been interested in how this relates to Game development in articles such as [Game Engines as prehension of incomputable data: the processual effectivities of game engines](https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/9662/1/gameengineprehension.pdf) and [Emergence in video game production: Video game engines as technical individuals ](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0539018416642056?journalCode=ssic) which talk about the possibilities and limits of different game engines.
>the research focuses on the ways in which the use of game engines - a toolkit that offeres a set of functionalities to automize the handling of a range of processes - make possible or impossible certain forms of emergences in video games production.

**RESEARCH AIM**
In our project we are exploring how the structure of programming languages affect the programmers approach to understanding the world around them. We will be examining the constraints of programming language, questioning how it influences the work we make as artists and the way we communicate with others. Making the hidden thinking processes visible by applying the syntax of programming languages to other forms.
