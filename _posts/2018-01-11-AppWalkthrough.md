Audible

Audiobooks	
The target users are probably adults, as children would be unable to purchase the audio books. 
They have a discover section for showing you books you don’t have, with recommendations. They use this section of the app to sell more books, but strangely you can’t actually buy new books in the app. You have to go onto the audible website, or amazon, and buy from there. I’ve always assumed that this was because just hasn’t been added yet, but now I wonder if this is on purpose, they show you things you might like then you go to the website where they have more screen space to sell you more. Perhaps they tested and people buy more if they have to visit the website than if they can be bought in app? Or perhaps it is to do with fees from apple on in-app purchases?

My library - lines that represent books on a shelf, one is tilted showing there is still room for more, always room for more. 

The books in the discovery area have user ratings as stars underneath the book title. Everything seems to have a good rating though? Perhaps this is just a reinforcement to the user and not an actual rating? 

The most interesting area is the ‘Me’ page. This has different measures of your use of the app. You collect badges depending on when and where you use the app. Use the app at night? You get the Night Owl badge with a little owl on it. These are designed to make people use the app more and more, if people want a badge they may start using the app in their car on the way to work and then get into the habit of using it then. They want you to use the app all the time, collecting all the badges make you do this. 
The next panel on the Me page has a listener rating, it make you feel like you don’t do enough. The more you listen the higher your rank is. To get to the Master Rank you need many hundreds of hours of using the app, and to spend that much time you would need to spend a lot of money on audiobooks. (E.g. (500 hours / 10 hours a book) * £8 a book = £400)
The last page shows a graph of your listening each year, If the line goes down it makes the suer feel like they are underachieving. They are encouraged to take on an unsustainable infinite growth in order for their metrics to look good.
All of this commodification of how much you listen to audiobooks is designed to make you want to improve on your score, and to do that you buy more audiobooks.
